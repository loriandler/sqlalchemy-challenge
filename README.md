Module 10 Challenge for UM Bootcamp

# Background
Congratulations!  You've decided to treat yourself to a lovely holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii.  To help with the trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. 

# Overview
The work with this assignment came together with Jupyter Notebook, data visualization, data manipulation, and database operations using Python libraries like Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite.

There were two parts to the assignment.

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
SQLAlchemy ORM Queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib were used to connect to an SQLite database, reflect tables into classes and link by creating an SQLAlchemy session.  Then Precipitation Analysis and a station analysis was done.

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App
Created for this was a homepage with available routes, precipitation results, a list of stations, temperature observations, and analysis from a particular start date or for a particular set of dates was provided.
